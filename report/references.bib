  abstract  = "Atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, is
               characterized by the buildup of lipids and chronic inflammation
               in the arteries, leading to plaque formation and potential
               rupture. The underlying causal immune mechanisms and alterations
               in structural cell composition and plasticity driving plaque
               progression remain incompletely defined. Recent advances in
               single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) have provided deeper
               insights into the roles of immune and non-immune cells in
               atherosclerosis. However, existing public scRNA-seq datasets
               often lack comprehensive cell type coverage and consistent
               annotations, posing challenges for downstream analyses. In this
               study, we present an integrated single-cell atlas of human
               atherosclerotic plaques, encompassing 261,747 high-quality
               annotated cells from carotid, coronary, and femoral arteries. By
               benchmarking and applying the best-performing data integration
               method, scPoli, we achieved robust cell type annotations
               validated by expert consensus and surface protein measurements.
               This comprehensive atlas enables accurate automatic cell type
               annotation of new datasets, optimal experimental design, and
               deconvolution of existing as well as novel bulk RNA-seq data to
               comprehensively determine cell type proportions in human
               atherosclerotic lesions. It facilitates future studies by
               providing an interactive WebUI for easy data annotation and
               experimental design, while supporting various downstream
               applications, including integration of genetic association
               studies and experimental planning.",

               wiring diagrams of tissues in health and disease, but
               comprehensive mapping of cell types in situ remains a challenge.
               Here we present сell2location, a Bayesian model that can resolve
               fine-grained cell types in spatial transcriptomic data and
               create comprehensive cellular maps of diverse tissues.
               Cell2location accounts for technical sources of variation and
               borrows statistical strength across locations, thereby enabling
               the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with
               higher sensitivity and resolution than existing tools. We
               assessed cell2location in three different tissues and show
               improved mapping of fine-grained cell types. In the mouse brain,
               we discovered fine regional astrocyte subtypes across the
               thalamus and hypothalamus. In the human lymph node, we spatially
               mapped a rare pre-germinal center B cell population. In the
               human gut, we resolved fine immune cell populations in lymphoid
               follicles. Collectively, our results present сell2location as a
               versatile analysis tool for mapping tissue architectures in a
               comprehensive manner.",

               disease and stroke. Despite the advance of lipid-lowering
               therapies and anti-hypertensive agents, the residual risk of an
               atherosclerotic event remains high, and developing therapeutic
               strategies has proven challenging. This is due to the complexity
               of atherosclerosis with a spatial interplay of multiple cell
               types within the vascular wall. In this study, we generated an
               integrative high-resolution map of human atherosclerotic plaques
               combining single-cell RNA sequencing from multiple studies and
               spatial transcriptomics data from 12 human specimens with
               different stages of atherosclerosis. Here we show
               cell-type-specific and atherosclerosis-specific expression
               changes and spatially constrained alterations in cell-cell
               communication. We highlight the possible recruitment of
               lymphocytes via ACKR1 endothelial cells of the vasa vasorum, the
               migration of vascular smooth muscle cells toward the lumen by
               transforming into fibromyocytes and cell-cell communication in
               the plaque region, indicating an intricate cellular interplay
